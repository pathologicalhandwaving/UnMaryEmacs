but getting you secured is straightforward I worked w/ wordpress with earthstrike's website as long as you're keeping up to date and don't let php run loose (again we can make that happen if its not already, not supremely difficult especially if its a basic install)

wordpress adds a small wrinkle in terms of attack surface but it's not uncommon and your situation should be amenable to all the normal approaches. I can't say I've done incident response for HIPPA before is there anything we'll need to keep around that we might otherwise delete? (Like any malware type stuff we see?)

y'all got this it's very recoverable, seems like worst has passed.

Oh sure I jsut want to make sure we don't install stuff that'd require like a team to keep going safely :)


So are you the only tech* person at this org?  whats the capacity for administrating this long term/ implementing stuff would it be beneficial to have me or someone else do that (it'd be pretty short, ubuntu makes it easy)

yeah that sounds like not the move (blocking china etc). Talking w/ one right now and they agree ssh key'd login only + update ssh every once in a while and fail2ban


Ok so there was an incident of some kind and we need to kinda lock down and re-establish trust. None of that is stupid, very informative :)

Can you go into more depth about the issue the org is going through and what systems they've got deployed? If I'm not able to help I know 2 networking types who are very friendly and depending on scope (I'm a little voulen-tolding here) could help too.

my main worry would be what user runs the php binary and what can it access. there was some nasty bug in pkexec that allowed privilege escalation that was in the news last week

ps aux | grep php

this method is silly in that it reports itself (expected)

oh wild
wordpress must be installed in a weird way
